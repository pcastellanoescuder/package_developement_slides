# (Basic) Package Structure

  1) `DESCRIPTION`: Metadata file. This file lets you describe what your package needs to work (p.e. dependences).    
  
  2) `NAMESPACE`: Defines what functions it makes available to other packages and what functions it requires from other packages.    
  
  3) `Code`: The most important directory is `R/`, where your R code lives.     
  
  4) `Tests`: To ensure your package works as designed, it’s essential to write unit tests which define correct behaviour, and alert you when functions break.  
  
  5) `Documentation`: To understand how to use the functions in your package, you’ll need to document them.    
  
  6) `Vignettes`: They’re long-form documents that show how to combine multiple parts of your package to solve real problems.

# Go for it!

## Create a package

```{r}
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/GRBIOseminar")
```

## Create a function

```{r}
usethis::use_r("GRBIOMedianImpute")
```

```{r}
GRBIOMedianImpute <- function(x){
  
  x[is.na(x)] <-  median(x, na.rm = T)
  return(x)

}
```

---

## Documentation

To write documentation use: `Code/Insert Roxygen Skeleton`

Then, write documentation of your function and run the following code to generate the documentation files (help files):

```{r}
devtools::document()
```

## Tests

Run the following code to create a `testthat` directory.  

```{r}
usethis::use_testthat()
```

Then, create your tests and evaluate them with:

```{r}
devtools::check()
# or
covr::package_coverage()
```

---

## Other Important Things

### Load your Package Under Developement 

```{r}
devtools::load_all() # loads a package. It roughly simulates what happens when a package is installed and loaded with library().
```

### Licenses

```{r}
usethis::use_gpl3_license("Pol Castellano")
```

### Continuous Integration and Badges

```{r}
usethis::use_travis() # This is a configuration file for the Travis CI continuous integration service. You can add a coverage test code line on the Travis.yml to evaluate the coverage of your package at each push!
usethis::use_appveyor() # This is a configuration file for the AppVeyor continuous integration service for Windows.
```
